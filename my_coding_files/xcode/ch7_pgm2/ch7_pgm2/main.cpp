 Purpose:
 A program that uses a structure named CorpData to store the following information on a company division: 
 division name (e.g., East, West, North, or South), qtr1 sales, qtr2 sales, qtr3 sales, and qtr4 sales

 Include a constructor that allows the division name and four quarterly sales amount to be specified at the time a CorpData variable is created.

 The program should create four CorpData variables, each representing one of the following corporate divisions: 
 East, West, North, and South.
 
 These variables should be passed one at a time, as constant references, to a function that computes the division’s annual sales total and quarterly average, and displays these along with the division name.
