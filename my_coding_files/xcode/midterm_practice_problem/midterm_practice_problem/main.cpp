 Purpose:
 Create an E-Book Sales program.  The program prompts the user to enter the number of e-books ordered. You must use a loop to validate the number of books entered. It must be a positive value.
 
 Use the following information to calculate the total sales price.

       Number of e-books                      Price ($) per copy

              < 10                                              10.5

           10-20                                                8.5

           21-30                                                6.5

           >30                                                   5.5
 
 In addition,  if the sales price is greater than $200 then there is an additional discount of 15% of the sales price. The final sales price needs to add WA sales tax of 8.6%.
 
 The final sales price (formatted) is displayed on the screen and written to disk.
