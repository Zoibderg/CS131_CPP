 Purpose: A program to calculate the number of slices a pizza of any size can be divided into.
 
 Ask the user for the diameter of the pizza in inches.
 Divide the diameter by 2 to get the radius.
 Calculate the number of slices that may be taken from a pizza of that size if each slice has an area of 12.789 square inches.
 Display a message telling the number of slices.
