 Exam Problem:
 Write a class, IncomeTaxCls. The class contains two attributes: a TaxpayerID and an annual income amount. The class must have a two-parameter constructor and member functions such as get and set member functions and a member function calculate(). The calculate( ) function is used to calculate a federal income tax amount based on the conditions below. Implement the class and the main( ) function.
 
 The main ( ) program/function must do the following tasks:
 
 1. Create an array of three objects (10 points) or one object (7 points), TaxPayerList, of the class calling/invoking the constructor. As a result, the data members/private members of the class will contain the assigned values passed to the constructor parameters.
 
 2. Create one object, TaxPayer4, of the class. Use the object to call the set member functions. As a result, the data members/private members of the class will contain the assigned values passed to the set member functions.
 
 3. Use a loop to iterate through each object in the TaxPayerList in which it calls the member function "calculate()".
 
 4. Use TaxPayer4 to call the member function calculate( ).
 
 5. Display the names, income amount, and tax amount(s) of all objects, TaxPayerList, and TaxPayer4.
