 Purpose:
 A change-counting game that asks the user to enter what coins to use to make exactly fifty cents.
 The program should ask the user to enter the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.
 If the total value of the coins entered is equal to fifty cents, the program should congratulate the user for winning the game.
 Otherwise, the program should display a message indicating whether the amount entered was more or less than fifty cents. 
 
 Use constant variables to hold the coin values.
