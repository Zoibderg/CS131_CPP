 Programmer: Austin Tesch
 Date modified: 05-17-24
 Compiler used: Â XCODE v. 15.0
 
 Purpose:
 The program must use a loop to validate their answer to ensure that it is either R (for a "runner") or W (for a "walker"). The next question is:
 
 How old are you?
 The program must use a loop to check if it is in the range of ages between 13 and 70.
 
 Furthermore, the program uses the following conditions to calculate the registration fee:
 For a runner, the registration fee is $45.50, and $35.00 for a walker.
 
 Also, use the following table to calculate a discount.

           Age             Percentage of Discount

           13-25                              10%

           26-60                             15%

           61-70                             20%
 
 Finally, the program must calculate the total registration and add an 8.6% sales tax to it.
