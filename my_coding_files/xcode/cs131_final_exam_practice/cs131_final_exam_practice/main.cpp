 Purpose:
 
 Part 1:
 
 Write a class, SalesCls, that contains two attributes (salesAmount and SalesRep). The class must have a constructor and a member function(s). The class must do desired tasks: Assign values (any sales amount, any sales representative's name), and calculate a commission amount based on the conditions below.
 
 Commission Rate Table:

 Sales Amount                   Commission Rate

 < 5000                                      1%

 between 5000 and 10000         2%

 > 10000                                    3%
 
 The main( ) must declare an object of the class. Use the object to call a class constructor and other member functions. The output should display the name, sales amount, and commission earned. Inputs could come from the user's inputs in the main( ).

 Write the class and the main( ) that has one object declared. The object calls the appropriate member function(s).
 
 ----------------------------------
 
 Part 2:

 Modify the program in which the sales amount, sales representative's name, and calculated commission amount will be written to disk. Review Chapter 5 Pages 287-292. Examine programs pr5_16.cpp and pr5_17.cpp.
 
 ------------------------------------
 
 Part 3:
 
 --------------------------------------

    Insert two lines of code toward the end of the program.  The first line is to create an array of three objects in the main ( ).  Review Chapter 8 Section 8.12. Program 8_28.cpp is a good example.  The second line of code is to use the object at subscript/index zero, to call a member function.
